# Make Change Project
##Week 1 weekend assignment for Skill Distillery

###Objectives

The project's overview from the Skill Distillery staff was to create a program where:

"In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed." 

This was the first major project assigned to be completed outside of class hours, and was evaluated on an individual basis. Other than the specific parameters set out in the project description, the main objective was to put to use the concepts, methods, logic, and many other things we learned during the first week. 

###Process

I chose to go in to the classroom at Skill Distillery and do the majority of my work on Saturday, August 5th. It's a great work environment and I knew I would produce a better program if I could ask questions to the Teacher's Assistant (TA) throughout. I started by pasting the project requirements into my program as comments. From there, I continued to make comments before writing code in order to break the project down and create an outline of what needed to be done. As I wrote code I would move or delete previous ideas and comments.

I started at the top declaring variables, writing dialogue, and creating method stubs. Next I created 'if' statements to ensure the proper dialogue would run at the right time. I periodically checked to make sure my code would compile. I started with just one array but as I wrote my 'for' loop I realized I needed one for math calculations and others to display values that I needed. 

After finishing the 'for' loop and tweaking lines the program ran as desired. All the code was written in the main method so next I went back to move blocks into other methods which left me with a short, clean, 'do-while' loop in my main. The last step was to run it again and then add more comments so that I can continue to reference this project in the future and know how it works.

###What I Learned

My personal goals were to accomplish as much as possible on my own, knowing that I would need some occasional help with filling in gaps between my logical thinking and what I can actually type with Java syntax to complete the project. Talking through my thought process out loud with the TA when necessary improved my understanding and created a better product. I am now more proficient at variables, creating methods, and logical reasoning, but I still have improvements to make on syntax and for loops I can tell I have learned because I can better explain things out loud and can bridge mental gaps more than I could earlier in the week.
