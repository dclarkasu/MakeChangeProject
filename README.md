# Make Change Project
##Week 1 weekend assignment for Skill Distillery

###Objectives
  The project's overview from the Skill Distillery staff was to create a program where:

  "In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed." 

  This was the first major project assigned to be completed outside of class hours, and was evaluated on an individual basis. Other than the specific parameters set out in the project description, the main objective was to put to use the concepts, methods, logic, and many other things we learned during the first week. 

###Process
  I chose to go in to the classroom at Skill Distillery and do the majority of my work on Saturday, August 5th. It's a great work environment and I knew I would produce a better program if I could ask questions to the Teacher's Assistant throughout. I started by pasting the project requirements into my program as comments. From there, I continued to make comments before writing code in order to break the project down and create an outline of what needed to be done. As I wrote code I would move or delete previous ideas and comments.
  



###What I Learned
  My personal goals were to accomplish as much as possible on my own, knowing that I may need some occasional help with some filling in gaps between my logical thinking and what I can actually type in Java syntax to complete the project.
